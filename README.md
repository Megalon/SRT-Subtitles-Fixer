SRT-Subtitles-Fixer
===================

This is a simple command line program to delay or speed up the timing of a ".srt" subtitle file. It reads all of the lines of the SRT file as a text document, parses the SRT timecode data, and applies a offset (positive or negative delay) to the timing of every subtitle.
